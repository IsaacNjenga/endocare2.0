              Type 2 Diabetes is a condition that occurs when your body cannot
              maintain healthy blood glucose (sugar) levels. Type 2 diabetes
              develops when your body:
              <ul>
                <li>Does not respond properly to insulin</li>
                <li>Gradually stops making enough insulin</li>
              </ul>
              Insulin is a hormone that controls the amount of glucose in your
              blood. Insulin helps glucose move from your blood into your cells,
              where it can be used for energy. In type 2 diabetes, your cells do
              not respond properly to insulin. This is known as ‚Äòinsulin
              resistance'. It causes glucose to stay in your blood, leading to
              high blood glucose levels. This is known as hyperglycaemia.
              <br /> <br /> Your chance of having type 2 diabetes increases with
              age. But it is possible for young people and even children to have
              type 2 diabetes.

            Your doctor will ask about your symptoms and examine you. They will
            also ask about your general health and family medical history. Your
            doctor will do blood glucose tests. You may have a:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Fasting blood glucose test ‚Äî where you don't eat for several

                Random blood glucose test ‚Äî where you don't need to stop eating
                before the test
              </li>
              <li>
                Oral glucose tolerance test ‚Äî where you have blood glucose tests

                HbA1C test ‚Äî which indicates how much sugar has been in your
                blood over the past few months
              </li>
            </ul>
            Depending on whether you have symptoms, you may need to have a
            repeat test. Other blood tests may be done to check for
            complications of type 2 diabetes. In some cases, you may also be
            asked to do a urine test.

            <li>Being very thirsty</li>

          Following a healthy lifestyle is very important in managing type 2
          diabetes. It‚Äòs important for controlling your blood glucose levels. It
          can also help to prevent complications. Lifestyle measures include:
          <ul>
            <li>Eating a healthy diet</li>
            <li>Being physically active</li>
            <li>Losing weight if you are overweight or obese</li>
            <li>Quitting smoking</li>
            <li>Limiting how much alcohol you drink</li>
          </ul>
          If you are overweight or obese, losing even 5% to 10% of your body
          weight can significantly improve your blood sugar control. If you
          follow lifestyle recommendations and lose weight, your diabetes can go
          into remission. This means that your blood glucose levels are well
          controlled for at least 3 months without needing medicines. <br />
          Your doctor or dietitian can advise you on what to eat to meet your
          nutritional needs and control your blood sugar levels
