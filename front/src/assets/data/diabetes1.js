            Diabetes is a condition that occurs when your body can‚Äôt maintain
            healthy levels of glucose (sugar) in your blood. In type 1 diabetes,
            your pancreas doesn‚Äôt make insulin. Insulin is a hormone that moves
            glucose out of your blood and into your cells, to be used for
            energy. Without insulin, glucose stays in your blood. This causes
            hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar). Type 1 diabetes can happen at any
            age but is more commonly diagnosed in young people. The most common
            age for diagnosis is 10 to 14 years. While there is currently no
            cure for type 1 diabetes, treatments are available.

          The exact cause of type 1 diabetes is not known. Type 1 diabetes is
          usually an autoimmune condition. Your body‚Äôs immune system attacks
          your pancreas and destroys the cells that make insulin. There is a
          genetic component to type 1 diabetes. That means you have a higher
          chance of having type 1 diabetes if a close family member has the
          condition.
